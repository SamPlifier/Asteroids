"The goal of the game is to move the ship around and avoid the asteroids as long as possible. Your mission is to code the rest of the game."

1. Create a ship object that contains the HTML element and keeps track of the velocity and angle
2. Implement the functionality to handle when keys are pressed
3. Move the ship according to the getShipMovement(...) function
4. Check for any collisions with asteroids (using the checkForCollisions() function which you must implement!)
5. How will you be able to loop through all asteroids to check for collisions? Where will you get the list of asteroids from?
